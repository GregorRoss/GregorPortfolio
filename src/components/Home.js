            Hi there, Iâ€™m Gregor | Software Engineer
        </h4>
        <div className='home-main'>

        <p> I am a passionate techie who embraces all areas of technology. I am focusing now on the software engineering or development side as I feel this brings the biggest difference to organisations on where they can improve their processes.</p>
      
        <p> I have been learning technology since 1990, when computers only had green screens. Every day I have continually had to learn and keep myself trained in technology. I am a quick learner and put into practice what I learn.</p>
     
        <p> I have created this site to show my skills and experience with a little sprinkling of my personality through it.</p>
