            Interests, just some of the interests that I have
        </h4>

        <p>
        I am a family first kind of person, once they are sorted work then I have a second passion, Ice hockey I do like to watch but I prefer to play. I have been playing ice hockey for six years and still love it. I currently play for the Coatbridge Redwings who are invited to two tournaments every year and have many friendly games throughout the season. I also try to play the guitar and do my best to have a garden that is in good condition to have friends and family round.
